## Build Status

## Tech/Framework/Code

Smorgasbord uses a combination of Javascript, CSS, and HTML to build the website. The use of node.js packages were important throughtout the project. Express, and handlebars were largely implimented as well. A new technology for our team was nodemailer package. This package sends out a confirmation email to those who have signed up for the website.

## How to use?

When a user goes to the depolyed [website]](https://smorgasbord.herokuapp.com/), they will first see the homepage where others have previously posted thier favorite restaraunts. If they want more details on any of the restaurants listed, or if they would like to post thier own reccomendations, they can navidage to the login page, where there will also be a sign-up form. From there the user can post, view, and comment on the entire website.
